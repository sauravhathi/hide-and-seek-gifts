## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The game hides three gifts (at random each time the game is loaded). Your task is to find the gifts.


Goal: Find the gifts in the fewest number of guesses. The game rates you according to your
performance.


Setup: When the game is loaded, the gifts are hidden at random by the computer on the grid. Then
the game asks you for your first guess.


**How you play:** The game will prompt for a guess, and you will type in the box as shown above and
press** “Guess”** button. In response to your guess, you will either see the **“Gift”** or **“Miss”** in the
corresponding grid location (refer figure above). When you find all the gifts, the game ends by
displaying your rating. In case you find the danger icon (only one such icon is hidden in the grid, at
random) the game will reset and all progress is lost.


The game will have three levels: 3x3 grid, 4x4 grid and 6x6 grid
